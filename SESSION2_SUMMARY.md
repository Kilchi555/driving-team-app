- StaffCashBalance (6)
- LocationSelector
- AddStudentModal
- LoginRegisterModal (8)

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Option A: AGGRESSIVE CONTINUATION (Realistic Today)
1. **ExamResultModal** (7) - 15 mins
2. **PendenzenModal** (6) - 15 mins
3. **CashTransactionModal** (7) - 15 mins
4. **StaffCashBalance** (6) - 15 mins
5. **LocationSelector** (?) - 15 mins
6. **AddStudentModal** (?) - 15 mins

= ~90 mins = Hit 35%+ easily!

Then continue for 50%+ (additional 90 mins):
7. **LoginRegisterModal** (8)
8. **RegistrationForm** (9)
9. **DocumentUploadModal** (9)
+ others

### Option B: Create Execution Scripts
For the super fast ones (1-2 queries), could script the replacements:
- StudentSelector, ProductSaleModal, EventTypeSelector
- 20 more similar small ones exist
