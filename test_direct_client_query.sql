-- TEST DIRECT CLIENT QUERY
-- ========================================
-- This mimics exactly what the frontend is doing

-- Step 1: Show what the frontend query should return
SELECT 
    'Frontend Query Simulation' as test,
    id,
    created_at,
    email,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    phone,

    street,

AND tenant_id = '78af580f-1670-4be3-a556-250339c872fa'
AND is_active = true
ORDER BY first_name;

-- Step 2: Check if there are any clients at all in this tenant
SELECT 
    'All clients in tenant' as test,
    COUNT(*) as total_clients,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_active = true) as active_clients,

WHERE role = 'client' 
AND tenant_id = '78af580f-1670-4be3-a556-250339c872fa';

-- Step 3: Check if Hans Meier matches the exact query
SELECT

    id, first_name, last_name, email, role, tenant_id, is_active,
    CASE

-- Step 4: Test RLS by simulating the exact frontend conditions
SELECT

FROM users 
WHERE role = 'client' 
AND tenant_id = '78af580f-1670-4be3-a556-250339c872fa'

-- Step 5: Success message
